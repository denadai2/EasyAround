\bf Design Model 	& \bf Worksheet DM-3: Architecture Specification \\
\hline\hline
\bf Architecture component & \bf Typical decision points 
\\ \hline
\sc controller & 
Mechanisms for internal/external event handling.
Concurrency? Interrupts possible? Allow what-if scenarios? 
User control over reasoning strategy? 
\\ \hline
\sc task & Can a task fail? Initialization method.
\\ \hline
\sc task method &
Language for control structure. Define where and in what way
the internal method control is specified:
declarative or procedural.
\\ \hline
\sc Inference & 
Define internal state variable; when should this
variable be reset, e.g., after task completion? Define operations for
execution and ``probe'' tests (has-solution?, new-solution?).
\\ \hline
\sc Inference method &
Many-to-many mapping from inference to inference method. Algorithm
should be selected. Catalog of inference methods?
\\ \hline
\sc Dynamic role &
Data types for roles. Access/modification operations for each data
type. 
\\ \hline
\sc Static role &
Define access operation: give-all, give-one, exists-one?
\\ \hline
\sc Knowledge base &
Decide about rule-instance representation. Define access and
modify/analyze methods. Cf. the domain-expert interface.
\\ \hline
\sc Views &
Standard graphical direct-manipulation interface? Special facilities
required (e.g., natural language production)? Different interface:
end-user, expert-user. Provide generic tracing facilities?
