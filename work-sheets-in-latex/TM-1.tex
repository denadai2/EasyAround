{\bf Task Model} &
{\bf Task Analysis Worksheet TM-1} \\
\hline
\hline
\sc Task & 
   Task identifier and task name
\\
\hline
\sc Organization & 
   Indicate the business process this task is a part of, and
   where in the organization (structure, people) it is carried out
\\
\hline
\sc Goal and value &
   Describe the goal of the task and the value that its execution adds
   to the process this task is a part of
\\
\hline
\sc Dependency and flow &
   {\em Input tasks}: tasks delivering inputs to this task
	\newline
   {\em Output tasks}: tasks that use (some of) the outputs of this
    task \newline
You can use a data-flow diagram or an activity diagram here to
describe this.
\\
\hline
\sc Objects handled &
   {\em Input objects}: 
   The objects, including information and knowledge items, that are
   input to the task
\newline
   {\em Output objects}: 
   The objects, including information and knowledge items, that are
   delivered by the task as outputs
\newline
   {\em Internal objects}
   Important objects (if any), including information and knowledge
   items, that are used internally within the task but are not input
   or output to other tasks
\newline
You may want to include a class diagram here to describe the
information objects handled by the task. 
\\
\hline
\sc Timing and control & 
Describe frequency and duration  of the task. \newline
Describe the control relation with other tasks. For this 
you may want to use a state diagram or a activity diagram. \newline
Describe control constraints: \newline
(i) {\em preconditions} that must hold before the task can be
executed; \newline
(ii) {\em postconditions} that must hold as result of execution of
   the task.
\\
\hline
\sc Agents & 
   The staff members
   and/or the information systems (cf. OM-2 and OM-3)
   that are responsible for carrying out the task
\\
\hline
\sc Knowledge and competence & 
   Competences needed for successful task performance.
   For the knowledge items involved, there is a separate worksheet
   TM-2. List other relevant skills and competences here.
   Indicate which elements of the task are knowledge intensive.
   Note that tasks can also {\em deliver} competences to the
   organization, and it may be worthwhile to indicate that here.
\\
\hline
\sc Resources & 
   Describe and preferably quantify the various resources consumed
   by the task (staff time, systems and equipment, materials, financial
   budgets.
\newline
   The description is typically a refinement of the resource
   descriptions in OM-2
\\
\hline
\sc Quality and performance & 
   List the quality and performance measures that are used by the
   organization to determine successful task execution
\\
\hline
