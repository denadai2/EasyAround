\sc Task & 
   Automated Design
\\
\hline
\sc Organization & 
   Task is controlled by the Travel Agent and executed by the appointed software. It is the product of non-human intervention.
\\
\hline
\sc Goal and value &
   The goal is the design of an itinerary composed of multiple locations, based on the preferences and the requirements set by the customer. 
\\
\hline
\sc Dependency and flow &
   {\em Input tasks}: Evaluate Request
	\newline
   {\em Output tasks}: Propose Itinerary \newline
\\
\hline
\sc Objects handled &
   {\em Input objects}: requirements, preferences and constraints from the customer.
\newline
   {\em Output objects}: itinerary.
\newline
   {\em Internal objects}: database of locations.
\newline
\\
\hline
\sc Timing and control & 
\textbf{Frequency and duration}: whenever a client asks for a custom-made itinerary, arbitrarily short duration. \newline
\textbf{Control relation}: \newline %TODO
(I) {\em Preconditions}: the request from the client must be organized in a set of requirements, constraints and preferences; \newline
(II) {\em Postconditions}: the itinerary must satisfy the request of the client.
\\
\hline
\sc Agents & 
   Travel Agent
\\
\hline
\sc Knowledge and competence & 
   Requirement rules, preference rules, constraint rules.
\\
\hline
\sc Resources & 
   Database of exsting locations, automated software for itinerary design, Travel Agent for customer interaction; 
\newline
   The duration of the interaction depends on the satisfaction of the client and he number of reviews requested on the itinerary. It should be in every occasion shorter than the duration of an interaction that does not include the automated system.
\\
\hline
\sc Quality and performance & 
   If the design is coherent with the requirements, if there are no constraint violations, if it corresponds to the preferences of the client, and it is at least the same or better than a manual design done by the TA, then it is of good quality.
