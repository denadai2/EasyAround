\begin{description}
  \item[Client] \hfill \\
  The client who goes to the travel agency. He can express preferences for a quiet enviroment and express his willingness to travel long distances by foot (\emph{dynamic}). The clients are categorized by their age to avoid unsuitable locations (ex: elderly people in a climbing location).
  
\item[Location] \hfill \\
  This model represents the point of interests that a customer could visit. The attribute \emph{rating} describes the quality of this place, \emph{intensive} describes if the place is not for quite people and \emph{excludedCategory} specifies if a client category is not suitable for the location (ex: elderly people in a climbing location). The method \emph{distance} takes two locations and returns the distance between them. It is useful in order to create the combination of locations to visit during a trip.
